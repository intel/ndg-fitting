Advanced topics
===============

This section discusses a number of advanced operations and ways of extending
Dr.Jit.

Improving introspection of Dr.Jit types in LLDB/GDB
--------------------------------------------------

When debugging programs built on top of Dr.Jit using `LLDB
<https://lldb.llvm.org/>`_ or `GDB <https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/>`_, the
stringified versions of arrays are needlessly verbose and reveal private
implementation details. For instance, printing a simple statically sized 3D
vectors like ``Array<float, 3>(1, 2, 3)`` in LLDB yields

.. code-block:: text

    $0 = {
      drjit::StaticArrayImpl<float, 3, false, drjit::Array<float, 3>, int> = {
        drjit::StaticArrayImpl<float, 4, false, drjit::Array<float, 3>, int> = {
          m = (1, 2, 3, 0)
        }
      }
    }

Dynamic arrays (e.g. ``FloatX(1, 2, 3)``) are even worse, as the values are
obscured behind a pointer:

.. code-block:: text

    $0 = {
      drjit::DynamicArrayImpl<drjit::Packet<float, 8>, drjit::DynamicArray<drjit::Packet<float, 8> > > = summary {
        m_packets = {
          __ptr_ = {
            std::__1::__compressed_pair_elem<drjit::Packet<float, 8> *, 0, false> = {
              __value_ = 0x0000000100300200
            }
          }
        }
        m_size = 1
        m_packets_allocated = 1
      }
    }

To improve readability, this repository includes scripts that improve GDB and LLDB's
understanding of Dr.Jit types. With this script, both of the above turn into

.. code-block:: text

    $0 = [1, 2, 3]

To install it in LLDB, copy the file ``resources/drjit_lldb.py`` to ``~/.lldb``
(creating the directory, if not present) and then apppend the following line to
the file ``~/.lldbinit`` (again, creating it if, not already present):

.. code-block:: text

    command script import ~/.lldb/drjit_lldb.py

To install it in GDB, copy the file ``resources/drjit_gdb.py`` to ``~/.gdb``
(creating the directory, if not present) and then apppend the following two lines to
the file ``~/.gdbinit`` (again, creating it if, not already present):

.. code-block:: text

    set print pretty
    source ~/.gdb/drjit_gdb.py

.. _compression:

Compressing arrays
------------------

A common design pattern in vectorized code involves *compressing* arrays, i.e.
selectively writing only masked parts of an array so that the selected entries
become densely packed in memory (e.g. to improve resource usage when only parts
of an array participate in a computation).

The function :cpp:func:`drjit::compress` efficiently maps this operation onto
the targeted hardware (SSE4.2, AVX2, and AVX512 implementations are provided).
The function also automatically advances the pointer by the amount of written
entries.

.. code-block:: cpp

    Array<float, 16> input = ...;
    auto mask = input < 0;

    float output[16], ptr = output;
    size_t count = compress(ptr, input, mask);
    std::cout << count << " entries were written." << std::endl;
    ...

Custom data structures such as the GPS record class discussed in previous
chapters are transparently supported by :cpp:func:`drjit::compress`---in this
case, the mask applies to each vertical slice through the data structure as
illustrated in the following figure:

.. image:: advanced-01.svg
    :width: 800px
    :align: center

The :cpp:func:`slice_ptr` function is used to acquire pointers to the
beginning of the output arrays (there is one for each field of the
data structure).
It returns a value of type ``GPSRecord2<float *>``, which holds these
pointers. The following snippet illustrates how an arbitrarily long list
of records can be compressed:

.. code-block:: cpp

    GPSCoord2fX input = /* .. input data to be compressed .. */;

    /* Make sure there is enough space to store all data */
    GPSCoord2fX output;
    set_slices(output, slices(input));

    /* Structure composed of pointers to the output arrays */
    GPSRecord2<float *> ptr = slice_ptr(output, 0);

    /* Counter used to keep track of the number of collected elements */
    size_t final_size = 0;

    /* Go through all packets, compress, and append */
    for (size_t i = 0; i < packets(input); ++i) {
        /* Let's filter out the records with input.reliable == false */
        auto input_p = packet(input, i);
        final_size += compress(ptr, input_p, input_p.reliable);
    }

    /* Now that the final number of slices is known, adjust the output array size */
    set_slices(output, final_size);

.. warning::

    The writes performed by :cpp:func:`drjit::compress` are at the granularity
    of entire packets, which means that some extra scratch space generally
    needs to be allocated at the end of the output array.

    For instance, even if it is known that a compression operation will find
    exactly ``N`` elements, you are required to reserve memory for ``N +
    Packet::Size`` elements to avoid undefined behavior.

    Note that :cpp:func:`drjit::compress` will never require more memory than
    the input array, hence this provides a safe upper bound.


Vectorized for loops
--------------------

Dr.Jit provides a powerful :cpp:func:`drjit::range` iterator that enables for
loops with index vectors. The following somewhat contrived piece of code
computes :math:`\sum_{i=0}^{1000}i^2` using brute force addition (but with only
:math:`1000/16\approx 63` loop iterations).

.. code-block:: cpp
    :emphasize-lines: 4

    using Index = Packet<uint32_t, 8>;

    Index result(0);

    for (auto [index, mask]: range<Index>(0, 1000)) {
        result += select(
            mask,
            index * index,
            Index(0)
        );
    }

    assert(hsum(result) == 332833500);

The mask is necessary to communicate the fact that the last loop iteration has
several disabled entries. An extended version of the range statement enables
iteration over multi-dimensional grids.

.. code-block:: cpp

    using Index3 = Array<Packet<uint32_t, 8>, 3>;

    for (auto [index, mask] : range<Index3>(4u, 5u, 6u))
        std::cout << index << std::endl;


    /* Output:
        [[0, 0, 0],
         [1, 0, 0],
         [2, 0, 0],
         [3, 0, 0],
         [0, 1, 0],
         [1, 1, 0],
         [2, 1, 0],
         [3, 1, 0]]
         ....
    */

Here, it is assumed that the range along each dimension starts from zero.

.. _scatter-gather:

Scatter, gather, and prefetches for SoA â†” AoS conversion
----------------------------------------------------------

Dr.Jit's :cpp:func:`scatter` and :cpp:func:`gather` functions can transparently
convert between SoA and AoS representations. This case is triggered when the
supplied index array has a smaller nesting level than that of the data array.
For instance, consider the following example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    /* Packet types */
    using FloatP    = Packet<float, 4>;
    using UInt32P   = Packet<uint32_t, 4>;

    /* SoA and AoS 3x3 matrix types */
    using Matrix3f  = Matrix<float, 3>;
    using Matrix3fP = Matrix<FloatP, 3>;

    Matrix3f *data = ...;
    UInt32P indices(5, 1, 3, 0);

    /* Gather AoS matrix data into SoA representation */
    Matrix3fP mat = gather<Matrix3fP>(data, indices);

    /* Modify SoA matrix data and scatter back into AoS-based 'data' array */
    mat *= 2.f;
    scatter(data, mat, indices);

The same syntax also works for :cpp:func:`prefetch`, which is convenient to
ensure that a given set of memory addresses are in cache (preferably a few
hundred cycles before the actual usage).

.. code-block:: cpp

    /* Prefetch into L2 cache for write access */
    prefetch<Matrix3fP, /* Write = */ true, /* Level = */ 2>(data, indices);

Dr.Jit is smart enough to realize that the non-vectorized form of gather and
scatter statements can be reduced to standard loads and stores, e.g.

.. code-block:: cpp

    using Matrix3f  = Matrix<float, 3>;
    float *ptr = ...;
    int32_t index = ...;

    /* The statement below reduces to load<Matrix3f>(ptr + index); */
    Matrix3f mat = gather<Matrix3f>(ptr, index);

Scatter and gather operations are also permitted for dynamic arrays, e.g.:

.. code-block:: cpp

    using FloatX    = DynamicArray<FloatP>;
    using UInt32X   = DynamicArray<UInt32P>;
    using Matrix3fX = Matrix<FloatX, 3>;

    Matrix3f *data = ...;
    UInt32X indices = ...;

    /* Gather AoS matrix data into SoA representation */
    Matrix3fX mat = gather<Matrix3fX>(data, indices);

.. _integer-division:

Vectorized integer division by constants
----------------------------------------

Integer division is a surprisingly expensive operation on current processor
architectures: for instance, the Knight's Landing architecture requires up to a
whopping *108 cycles* (95 cycles on Skylake) to perform a single 64-bit signed
integer division with remainder. The hardware unit implementing the division
cannot accept any new inputs until it is done with the current input (in other
words, it is not *pipelined* in contrast to most other operations).
Given the challenges of efficiently realizing integer division in hardware,
current processors don't even provide an vector instruction to perform multiple
divisions at once.

Although Dr.Jit can't do anything clever to provide an efficient array division
instruction given these constraints, it does provide a highly efficient
division operation for a special case that is often applicable: *dividing by an
integer constant*. The following snippet falls under this special case because
all array entries are divided by the same constant, which is furthermore known
at compile time.

.. code-block:: cpp

    using Int32 = drjit::Array<uint32_t, 8>;

    Int32 div_43(Int32 a) {
        return a / 43;
    }

This generates the following AVX2 assembly code (with comments):

.. code-block:: nasm

    _div_43:
        ; Load magic constant into 'ymm1'
        vpbroadcastd  ymm1, dword ptr [rip + LCPI0_0]

        ; Compute high part of 64 bit multiplication with 'ymm1'
        vpmuludq      ymm2, ymm1, ymm0
        vpsrlq        ymm2, ymm2, 32
        vpsrlq        ymm3, ymm0, 32
        vpmuludq      ymm1, ymm1, ymm3
        vpblendd      ymm1, ymm2, ymm1, 170

        ; Correction & shift
        vpsubd        ymm0, ymm0, ymm1
        vpsrld        ymm0, ymm0, 1
        vpaddd        ymm0, ymm0, ymm1
        vpsrld        ymm0, ymm0, 5
        ret

We've effectively turned the division into a sequence of 2 multiplies, 4
shifts, and 2 additions/subtractions. Needless to say, this is going to be much
faster than sequence of high-latency/low-througput scalar divisions.

In cases where the constant is not known at compile time, a
:cpp:class:`drjit::divisor` instance can be precomputed and efficiently applied
using :cpp:func:`drjit::divisor::operator()`, as shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    using Int32P = drjit::Packet<uint32_t, 8>;

    void divide(Int32P *a, int32_t b, size_t n) {
        // Precompute magic constants
        divisor<int32_t> prec_div = b;

        // Now apply the precomputed division efficiently
        for (size_t i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            a[i] = prec_div(a[i]);
    }

The following plots show the speedup compared to scalar division when dividing
100 million integer packets of size 16 by a compile-time constant. As can be
seen, the difference is fairly significant on consumer processors (up to
**13.2x** on Skylake) and *huge* on the simple cores found on a Xeon Phi (up to
**61.2x** on Knight's Landing).

.. image:: advanced-03.svg
    :width: 600px
    :align: center

.. image:: advanced-02.svg
    :width: 600px
    :align: center

Dr.Jit's implementation of division by constants is based on the excellent
`libdivide <https://github.com/ridiculousfish/libdivide>`_ library.

.. note::

    As can be seen, unsigned divisions are generally cheaper than signed
    division, and 32 bit division is considerably cheaper than 64 bit
    divisions. The reason for this is that a *64 bit high multiplication*
    instruction required by the algorithm does not exist and must be emulated.

.. warning::

    Dr.Jit's integer precomputed division operator does not support dividends
    equal to :math:`\pm 1` (all other values are permissible). This is an
    inherent limitation of the magic number & shift-based algorithm used
    internally, which simply cannot represent this dividend. Dr.Jit will throw
    an exception when a dividend equal to :math:`\pm 1` is detected in an
    application compiled in debug mode.

.. _reinterpret:

Reinterpreting the contents of arrays
-------------------------------------

The function :cpp:func:`reinterpret_array` can be used to reinterpret the
bit-level representation as a different type when both source and target types
have matching sizes and layouts.

.. code-block:: cpp

    using UInt32P = Packet<uint32_t, 4>;
    using FloatP = Packet<float, 4>;

    UInt32P source = 0x3f800000;
    FloatP target = reinterpret_array<FloatP>(source);

    // Prints: [1, 1, 1, 1]
    std::cout << target << std::endl;

.. _transform:

The histogram problem and conflict detection
--------------------------------------------

Consider vectorizing a function that increments the bins of a histogram given
an array of bin indices. It is impossible to do this kind of indirect update
using a normal pair of *gather* and *scatter* operations, since incorrect
updates occur whenever the ``indices`` array contains an index multiple times:

.. code-block:: cpp

    using FloatP = Packet<float, 16>;
    using IndexP = Packet<int32_t, 16>;

    float hist[1000] = { 0.f }; /* Histogram entries */

    IndexP indices = /* .. bin indices whose value should be increased .. */;

    /* Ooops, don't do this. Some entries may have to be incremented multiple times.. */
    scatter(hist, gather<FloatP>(hist, indices) + 1, indices);

Dr.Jit provides a function named :cpp:func:`drjit::transform`, which modifies an
indirect memory location in a way that is not susceptible to conflicts. The
function takes an arbitrary function as parameter and applies it to the
specified memory location, which allows this approach to generalize to
situations other than just building histograms.

.. code-block:: cpp

    /* Unmasked version */
    transform<FloatP>(hist, indices, [](auto& x, auto& /* mask */) { x += 1; });

    /* Masked version */
    transform<FloatP>(hist, indices, [](auto& x, auto& /* mask */) { x += 1; }, mask);

A mask argument is always provided to the lambda function. This is useful, e.g.
to mask memory operations or function calls performed inside it. Note that any
extra arguments will also be passed to the lambda function:

.. code-block:: cpp

    FloatP amount = ...;

    /* Unmasked version */
    transform<FloatP>(hist, indices,
                      [](auto& x, auto&y, auto & /* mask */) { x += y; },
                      amount);

    /* Masked version */
    transform<FloatP>(hist, indices,
                      [](auto& x, auto&y, auto& /* mask */) { x += y; },
                      amount, mask);

Internally, :cpp:func:`drjit::transform` detects and processes conflicts using
the AVX512CDI instruction set. When conflicts are present, the function
provided as an argument may be invoked multiple times in a row. When AVX512CDI
is not available, a slower scalar fallback implementation is used.

Since the above use pattern---adding values to an array---is so common, a
special short-hand notation exists:

.. code-block:: cpp

    FloatP amount = ...;

    /* Unmasked version */
    scatter_add(hist, amount, indices);

    /* Masked version */
    scatter_add(hist, amount, indices, mask);


.. _custom-arrays:

Defining custom array types
---------------------------

Dr.Jit provides a mechanism for declaring custom array types using the
`Curiously recurring template pattern
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curiously_recurring_template_pattern>`_. The
following snippet shows a declaration of a hypothetical type named ``Spectrum``
representing a discretized color spectrum. ``Spectrum`` generally behaves the
same way as :cpp:class:`Array` and supports all regular Dr.Jit operations.

.. code-block:: cpp

    template <typename Value, size_t Size>
    struct Spectrum : drjit::StaticArrayImpl<Value, Size, false,
                                             Spectrum<Value, Size>> {

        /// Base class
        using Base = drjit::StaticArrayImpl<Value, Size, false,
                                            Spectrum<Value, Size>>;

        /// Helper alias used to implement type promotion rules
        template <typename T> using ReplaceValue = Spectrum<T, Size>;

        /// Mask type associated with this custom type
        using MaskType = drjit::Mask<Value, Size>;

        /// Import constructors, assignment operators, etc.
        DRJIT_IMPORT_ARRAY(Base, Spectrum)
    };

The main reason for declaring custom arrays is to tag (and preserve) the type
of arrays within expressions. For instance, the type of ``value2`` in the
following snippet is ``Spectrum<float, 8>`` rather than a generic
``drjit::Array<...>``.

.. code-block:: cpp

    Spectrum<float, 8> value = { ... };
    auto value2 = exp(-value);

.. note::

    A further declaration is needed in a rare corner case. This only applies

    1. if you plan to use the new array type *within custom data structures*, and
    2. if *masked assignments* to the custom data structure are used, and
    3. if the custom data structure creates instances of the new array type
       from its template parameters.

    An example:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        // 1. Custom data structure
        template <typename Value> struct PolarizedSpectrum {
            // 3. Spectrum type constructed from template parameters
            using Spectrum8 = Spectrum<Value, 8>;
            Spectrum8 r_s;
            Spectrum8 r_p;
            DRJIT_STRUCT(PolarizedSpectrum, r_s, r_p)
        };
        DRJIT_STRUCT_SUPPORT(PolarizedSpectrum, r_s, r_p)

        using PolarizedSpectrumfP = PolarizedSpectrum<FloatP>;

        PolarizedSpectrumfP some_function(FloatP theta) {
            PolarizedSpectrumfP result = ...;
            // 2. Masked assignment
            masked(result, theta < 0.f) = zero<PolarizedSpectrumfP>();
            return result;
        }

    In this case, the following declaration is needed:

    .. code-block:: cpp

        template <typename Value, size_t Size>
        struct Spectrum<drjit::detail::MaskedArray<Value>, Size> : drjit::detail::MaskedArray<Spectrum<Value, Size>> {
            using Base = drjit::detail::MaskedArray<Spectrum<Value, Size>>;
            using Base::Base;
            using Base::operator=;
            Spectrum(const Base &b) : Base(b) { }
        };

    This partial overload has the purpose of propagating an internal Dr.Jit
    masking data structure to the top level (so that ``Spectrum<MaskedArray>``
    becomes ``MaskedArray<Spectrum>``).

.. _platform-differences:

Architectural differences handled by Dr.Jit
------------------------------------------

In addition to mapping vector operations on the available instruction sets,
Dr.Jit's abstractions hide a number of tedious platform-related details. This is
a partial list:

1. The representation of masks is highly platform-dependent. For instance, the
   AVX512 back-end uses eight dedicated mask registers to store masks compactly
   (allocating only a single bit per mask entry).

   Older machines use a redundant representation based on regular vector
   registers that have all bits set to ``1`` for entries where the comparison
   was true and ``0`` elsewhere.

2. Machines with AVX (but no AVX2) don't have an 8-wide integer vector unit.
   This means that an ``Array<float, 8>`` can be represented using a single AVX
   ``ymm`` register, but casting it to an ``Array<int32_t, 8>`` entails
   switching to a pair of half width SSE4.2 ``xmm`` integer registers, etc.

3. Vector instruction sets are generally fairly incomplete in the sense that
   they are missing many entries in the full *data type* / *operation* matrix.
   Dr.Jit emulates such operations using other vector instructions whenever
   possible.

4. Various operations that work with 64 bit registers aren't available
   when Dr.Jit is compiled on a 32-bit platform and must be emulated.

Adding backends for new instruction sets
----------------------------------------

Adding a new Dr.Jit array type involves creating a new partial overload of the
``StaticArrayImpl<>`` template that derives from ``StaticArrayBase``. To
support the full feature set of Dr.Jit, overloads must provide at least a set of
core methods shown below. The underscores in the function names indicate that
this is considered non-public API that should only be accessed indirectly via
the routing templates in ``drjit/drjit_router.h``.

* The following core operations must be provided by every implementation.

  * Loads and stores: ``store_``, ``store_unaligned_``, ``load_``,
    ``load_unaligned_``.

  * Arithmetic and bit-level operations: ``add_``, ``sub_``, ``mul_``,
    ``mulhi_`` (signed/unsigned high integer multiplication), ``div_``,
    ``mod_``, ``and_``, ``or_``, ``xor_``.

  * Unary operators: ``neg_``, ``not_``.

  * Comparison operators that produce masks: ``ge_``, ``gt_``, ``lt_``, ``le_``,
    ``eq_``, ``neq_``.

  * Other elementary operations: ``abs_``, ``ceil_``, ``floor_``, ``max_``,
    ``min_``, ``round_``, ``sqrt_``.

  * Shift operations for integers: ``sl_``, ``sr_``.

  * Horizontal operations: ``all_``, ``any_``, ``hprod_``, ``hsum_``,
    ``hmax_``, ``hmin_``, ``count_``.

  * Masked blending operation: ``select_``.

  * Access to low and high part (if applicable): ``high_``, ``low_``.

  * Zero-valued array creation: ``zero_``.

* The following operations all have default implementations in Dr.Jit's
  mathematical support library, hence overriding them is optional.

  However, doing so may be worthwile if efficient hardware-level support exists
  on the target platform.

  * Shuffle operation (emulated using scalar operations by default):
    ``shuffle_``.

  * Compressed stores (emulated using scalar operations by default):
    ``compress_``.

  * Extracting an element based on a mask (emulated using scalar operations by default):
    ``extract_``.

  * Scatter/gather operations (emulated using scalar operations by default):
    ``scatter_``, ``gather_``.

  * Prefetch operations (no-op by default): ``prefetch_``.

  * Fused multiply-add routines (reduced to ``add_``/``sub_`` and ``mul_`` by
    default): ``fmadd_``, ``fmsub_``, ``fnmadd_``, ``fnmsub_``,
    ``fmaddsub_``, ``fmsubadd_``.

  * Reciprocal and reciprocal square root (reduced to ``div_`` and ``sqrt_``
    by default): ``rcp_``, ``rsqrt_``.

  * Dot product (reduced to ``mul_`` and ``hsum_`` by default): ``dot_``.

  * Optional bit-level rotation operations (reduced to shifts by default):
    ``rol_``,  ``ror_``.

  * Optional array rotation operations (reduced to shuffles by default):
    ``rotate_left_``, ``rotate_right_``.
